# Memory-Management-Technique

This program was made as a part of Assignement for the course CS558:Computer Systems Lab by Prof. Moumita Patra, IITG, CSE for semester Jan-May 2023 . Detailed Problem Statement can be found in Assignment6.pdf Question 2.

The program is meant to do a comparative study of paging system and non-paging system, also performance of paging system's dependence of several parameters such as page-replacement algorithm(LRU,FIFO,random) , swap-space size, page size.

The entire code is divided into 3 sub modules

Data Generator to simulate the data generation.
Non-Paging System implements the contiguos allocation(variable partition) technique using first fit algorithm.
Paging System implements paging system.
